## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
```

```{r}
games <- import("master.csv")
```

### Seasons
```{r}
games %>%
  group_by(season, genre) %>%
  summarize(n=n())
```

### Distinct Games
```{r}
unique_games = games %>% select(-platform_name) %>% distinct()
```
```{r}
unique(games$platform_name)
```
```{r}
unique_games %>%
  ggplot(aes(season, metacritic)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.5)
```
